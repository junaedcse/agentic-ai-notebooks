    "# Agentic RAG System with External API Integration\n",
    "## Sr. AI/ML Engineer Technical Challenge - Complete Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Md Junaedur Rahman  \n",
    "**Date**: November 10, 2025  \n",
    "**Task**: Hybrid LLM application combining RAG and API calls with intelligent routing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation creates an **agentic RAG system** that intelligently routes user queries to appropriate data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG System**: For queries about AI/ML concepts from the provided knowledge base\n",
    "2. **External API**: For queries about albums from JSONPlaceholder API\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Mode**: Combines both sources when relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Intent-based routing**: LLM determines which source(s) to use based on query context\n",
    "-  **No hard-coded patterns**: Uses LLM reasoning instead of regex matching\n",
    "-  **Fallback handling**: Mock data if API is unavailable\n",
    "-  **Multi-source synthesis**: Coherent responses combining RAG + API results\n",
    "-  **Production-ready**: Error handling, logging, type hints, documentation\n",
    "\n",

      "💡 FINAL ANSWER:\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "Early AI researchers faced several challenges, primarily due to overly optimistic predictions about the capabilities of AI. They severely underestimated the complexity of certain problems. For instance, while they succeeded in creating programs that could play chess, they found that recognizing chess pieces in video was significantly more difficult. This highlights the broader challenge of dealing with real-world perception and understanding, which proved to be much more complex than initially anticipated.\n",

    "## 11. Summary and Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Task Requirements Met\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hybrid LLM Application**: Combines RAG retrieval and external API calls\n",
    "2. **Intelligent Routing**: LLM determines which function to call based on query intent\n",
    "3. **No Hard-Coded Patterns**: Uses semantic understanding, not regex matching\n",
    "4. **Multi-Source Synthesis**: Can combine RAG and API results coherently\n",
    "5. **Fallback Handling**: Mock data available if API is down\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Architecture Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph for stateful workflows\n",
    "- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 for superior reasoning\n",
    "- **RAG**: FAISS vector store with OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "- **External API**: JSONPlaceholder albums endpoint\n",
    "- **State Management**: Persistent conversation state with memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Tools Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `search_documents`: RAG retrieval from AI knowledge base\n",
    "2. `get_albums`: Fetch albums from external API\n",
    "3. `search_albums_by_user`: Filtered album retrieval by user ID\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehensive documentation and type hints\n",
    "- Error handling and graceful degradation\n",
    "- Modular, maintainable architecture\n",
    "- Production-ready with logging and observability\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this system:\n",
    "- Add more tools (weather API, database queries, etc.)\n",
    "- Implement conversation history for multi-turn dialogues\n",
    "- Add streaming for real-time responses\n",
    "- Deploy as a FastAPI or Flask web service\n",
    "- Add authentication and rate limiting for production"
